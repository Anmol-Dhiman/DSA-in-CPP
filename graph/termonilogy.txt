the termonology in graph: - 

1. directed graph : - when the edge have the direction of movement.
2. undirected graph : - when the edge do not have the direction of movement i.e. the we can go from one node to another

degree: - 
the degree is always calculated for the directed graph
1. indegree: - the number of edges coming to the node.
2. outdegree: - the number of edges outgoing to the node.


cycle in a graph is is called cyclic graph and it's vice versa is called acyclic graph


**tree is a connected acyclic graph

topological sort: - 

only directed acyclic graph have the topological sequence 
and this sequence is not unique one graph have many topological sequence

first adding the nodes whose indegree is zero and then subtract 1 form the indegree of adjacent node 
and then do the first step.
this is the way to write the topological sequence
